### Objective 
Using the NYC Taxi Rides dataset to predict ride duration given two external datasets: the NYC weather dataset and the NYC accidents dataset.

#### Data Wrangling
- Querying for data from a database using SQL
- Basic data cleaning using SQL/Pandas

#### EDA, Visualization, Feature Engineering
- Exploratory data analysis of the NYC Taxi dataset
- Generate visualizations to gain insight on the dataset

#### External Datasets
- Exploratory data analysis of the NYC accidents dataset
- Join the taxi dataset with NYC accidents dataset, make connection, and observations

#### Feature Engineering and Model Fitting
- Feature engineering based on gained insights
- Modeling with sklearn data pipelines


**Note:** In order to use our manipulated datasets across different parts of the project, you will need to save your tables into .hdf files and loading them when needed. 

We give license for our code to be shared.
